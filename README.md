* # Project description:
  Given a need to create and display a visual representation of my team, I used the Inquirer and Jest packages with Node.js to create a command line program that will lead you through prompts, ultimately generating a custom HTML file for you with all your teams info. You may also choose between a few templates that dictate your HTML page's color scheme.

* # Additional comments
(May/17/21)

  - I appologize for the long demo video, didnt expect the email window to pop up tandem-page :/

  - In the dist folder, there will be two page examples.

  - Instead of comments on all of the classes and tests, I have commented on the mgmt portions of both. comments carry over.

(Nov/10/21)

  - For some reason my jest script no longer worked as intended, so I adjusted its script in the package.json.
